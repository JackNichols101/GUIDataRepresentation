- No directions beyond the basics
- My project uses an API key to retrieve college data, then makes a database file, and fills it with the database with the data I received.

- Nothing is missing from the project, the workflow run is completed successfully with the 2 tests 
- I created one table, colleges, that has a column for school id, state, city, size in 2017 and 2018, earnings over the poverty line 3 years after completion 2017, and overall repayment after 3 years 2016. I also made 2 automated tests to make sure that the program is running as intended.
